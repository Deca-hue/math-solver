# 🚀 Practice Projects Hub

Welcome to the **Practice Projects Hub** — a clean, responsive, and interactive **HTML + Tailwind CSS + JavaScript** website that serves as a gateway to all my mini practice projects.  
Each button on this site is linked to a unique project I’ve built while practicing frontend development.

---

## 📌 Overview

This site acts as a **centralized hub** for my small practice projects. Instead of manually navigating through folders, you can simply click a button and instantly open the project in your browser.  

Perfect for:
- Organizing projects in one place
- Quickly showcasing work to others
- Practicing Tailwind CSS styling and JavaScript event handling

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – Structure of the site  
- **Tailwind CSS** – Modern utility-first styling  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – Handling button click navigation  
- **GitHub Pages** – Hosting and easy access to projects

## 🎯 Features

✅ **Central Hub** – All projects accessible from one page  
✅ **Instant Navigation** – Click a button → Project opens in the same tab or new tab  
✅ **Tailwind Styling** – Modern and responsive design  
✅ **Lightweight** – Minimal and fast-loading

If you want, I can also **write the index.html + Tailwind + JS button navigation code** so your README matches a working site. That way, anyone cloning it can run it instantly without extra setup.  

Do you want me to include that code in this README?
